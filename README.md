# Password-Generator-
The password generator script I provided is a simple Python program that prompts the user for certain input and generates a password based on that input. 
ere are some of the key features of this script:

User input: The script prompts the user for the desired length of the password, as well as the types of characters to include (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters)

Character types: The script allows the user to specify which types of characters they would like to include in the password, using the string.ascii_uppercase, string.ascii_lowercase, string.digits, and string.punctuation variables from the string module.

Randomness: The script uses the random.choice() function from the random module to randomly select characters for the password, ensuring that the resulting password is unique and secure.

Customization: The script is designed to be flexible and easy to customize. The user can set length and set of characters to be used, allowing for a wide range of possible passwords to be generated.
Identification: It includes the Creator Name “Lekside Nation” which could be used to identify the creator of this script.

Note that, this script is a simple example and it is intended to generate random password and it should not be used as a substitute of more secure password generation and management solution.
